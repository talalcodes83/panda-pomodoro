# Setting up GitHub Repository

Your git repository is initialized and ready! Follow these steps to push to GitHub:

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `cute-pomodoro-timer` (or any name you prefer)
3. Description: "A cute pixel art style pomodoro timer with music playlist - Built with Tauri + Svelte + TypeScript"
4. Make it **Public** or **Private** (your choice)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect and Push

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/talalcodes83/cute-pomodoro-timer.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Note:** Replace `cute-pomodoro-timer` with your actual repository name if different.

## Alternative: Using SSH

If you prefer SSH (and have it set up):

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:talalcodes83/cute-pomodoro-timer.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## That's it! 🎉

Your code will be on GitHub and ready to share!
